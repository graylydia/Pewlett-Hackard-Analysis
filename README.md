# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
## Overview of the Pewlett Hackard Analysis
### Purpose
Pewlett Hackard, a large company, is looking towards the future and needs help determining who will be retiring in the next few years and how many positions need to be filled. We built an employee database that determined these two questions as well as how many employees are retiring per title and the number of employees that are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Through Structured Query Language we were able to prepare Pewlett Hackard for the upcoming “silver tsunami”.
## Results
* In total, there are 72,458 retiring employees that have a title.
